      Dear Atharva, 
<br/><br/>
Oh my khupush khupush! (*kisses lots and lots of kisses)... <br/>
Toh this is the first ever letter I am writing to you. I am totally blank and I really dk what to write so pardon for any mistakes, the whole purpose of this letter is make you kiss me hard in the end (arey sach bol diya, dhat!) han toh purpose is to wish you very very very very happy birthday! <br/><br/>

Tum Jiyo Hajaro sal ke saal ke din ho ek hajar, Happy Birthday Athu ❤️ <br/><br/>

Umm I think I have said this so many times but I’m gonna repeat it again, I’m really grateful to have you. Never ever I thought ki I would be dating the very guy I stalked in my FY for having the highest grades lol. Oof~ I am short of words right now. 

You know you bring that sunshine into my dark thoughts. I know I can be a handful sometimes but over time you have assured me that you can handle me. The way you have loved me, love me and (I know) gonna love me is so intimate. The shower of this unconditional love makes me wanna love you more and more. I wanna spoil you, buy you flowers, chocolates (this I never did right, oh you gonna get one on birthday then hehe), gifts…you know that mockingbird song lolz.
Oh, that himym wala thingy, we know everything about each other, ‘officially the old couple’ oh that is goal lmao. <br/><br/>

Thanks for being a best friend, best boyfriend, best mentor and my fav snack (mast mast mota hehe, khau ka tula hmpf) <br/><br/>

Well again idk what to write, ik know you have achieved this letter through thoda kashta lolz and might expect more but idt I can think or write more at this point. (yep I read books and can’t write however you can write but dont read books) <br/><br/>

Happy 22nd Athu, <br/><br/>
On your special day, I hope you get everything you've been wishing for. May your birthday be just the beginning of a fantastic year ahead, filled with new anime releases, exciting adventures, and lots of love from those around you. (this is totally copied from net hehe but I mean it, kharach) <br/><br/>

<br/>
- Your Gabu hehe
